# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  

This project is designed to demonstrate key SQL skills typically used by data analysts for exploring, cleaning, and analyzing retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those starting their journey in data analysis and looking to strengthen their SQL foundation.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project begins by creating a database named `sql_mainproject`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,    
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,    
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,    
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find the number of unique customers in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and remove records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Retrieve all sales made on '2022-11-05':**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Retrieve transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and quantity sold is more than 4 in November 2022:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
    AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND quantity >= 4;
```

3. **Calculate total sales for each product category:**

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

4. **Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category:**

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

5. **Retrieve transactions where the total sale amount is greater than 1000:**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

6. **Find the total number of transactions made by each gender in each category:**

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
```

7. **Calculate the average sale for each month and identify the best-selling month in each year:**

```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month
) AS ranked_sales
WHERE rank = 1;
```

8. **Find the top 5 customers based on total sales:**

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category:**

```sql
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

10. **Categorize sales by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and find the number of orders in each shift:**

```sql
WITH hourly_sales AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders    
FROM hourly_sales
GROUP BY shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset contains a diverse customer base, with customers across various age groups. Sales are spread across different product categories such as Clothing, Beauty, and more.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis reveals fluctuations in sales, helping identify peak seasons or trends.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis highlights the top-spending customers and shows which categories are more popular among different customer segments.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.
